// Package iamctl provides the functions used by the iamctl command line tool
// under github.com/marmotedu/iam/cmd. The functions are kept in this package to better
// support unit testing. The main() method for iamctl is only an entry point
// and should contain no functionality.
package iamctl // import "github.com/marmotedu/iam/internal/iamctl"
